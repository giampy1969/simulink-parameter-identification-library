# simulink-parameter-identification-library

This Simulink&reg; library is a collection of blocks that perform Parameter Identification 
through the most rewarded frequency and time domain linear regression methods. 
It works in Matlab 5.3.1 as well as in later versions.

Main examples are:

-) Recursive Least Squares (RLS).
-) Simple Windowed Regression (LLS).
-) Local Weighted Regression (LWR).
-) Fourier Transform Regression (FTR).

Two example on Linear and Nonlinear Aircraft
Parameter Identification are included in the library.

IMPORTANT, all of these blocks REQUIRE SMXL
(the Simulink Matrix Library) freely available in the File exchange section of the MATLAB Central website.
